                            In 2017 and 2018  Palstart implemented the  Introduction to Programming for ages 8-12 using the <a href="https://code.org/" target="_blanck">Code.org</a> curriculum. This project was carried out in the West Bank village of Silwad. From these courses we found that the children in Palestine have a natural curiosity to learn more about computer science.
